        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching, whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.</p>

            <p>So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and get out into the great outdoors!</p>
      </section>
    <!-- section for welcome is separate from the section for pics, but all are contained within 'main'-->
    <aside>
    <!-- we talked about the 'article' tag in class, but I can't find where that might go, and this resembles the picture with no red, so I'm leaving it as is.-->
      <h2>Favourite photos</h2>
